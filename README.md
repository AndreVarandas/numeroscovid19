# numeroscovid19

**Archived because the data is no longer provided in a daily report**

Frontend that uses [https://github.com/AndreVarandas/portugal-covid-19-api](https://github.com/AndreVarandas/portugal-covid-19-api) api to show covid-19 numbers in Portugal, in a simple **uninspired** dashboard.

No charts. Just numbers.

## Motivation

Lack of a website that could easily display the numbers. Sometimes you miss the news and just want to know how the pandemic is progressing. I made it for myself a while ago, I am now rebuilding the dashboard and making it public for everyone to use.

Anyone is welcome to submit ideas and improvements.

## Build Setup

This project is made using the intuitive Vue Framework [https://nuxtjs.org/](https://nuxtjs.org/)

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
